> Hello there! I’m Ali Khafagy also known as Khafagy. I am 22 years old, I am a CS student, and a Cybersecurity enthusiast. My dream is to work as a red team operator and I‘ve created this blog to measure my progress towards it, share my thoughts, and ideas, and maybe help people who have the same goals as me. I will use this site as a resource for learning and hope other people will get as enthusiastic as I am and start making the cyber world a bit safer.
